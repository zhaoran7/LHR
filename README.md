# LHR

## **Independent association of leg-height ratio with 15 cardiometabolic diseases**

### *Abstract*

The causal association between adult height and coronary artery disease (CAD) was established a decade ago. Accumulating evidence has since linked adult height to a variety of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). As waist-hip ratio has become an increasingly important independent risk factor in addition to body mass index, we hypothesize that leg-height ratio (LHR) could also be a risk factor independent of overall height. 
We defined LHR as the ratio of leg length to standing height and further adjusted it for overall height by regression. We first performed a novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) on LHR, identifying 740 genome-wide significant loci (lead SNP P < 5×10<sup>-8</sup> in both unconditional and conditional analyses). SNP-based heritability was estimated at 24% for LHR, versus 46% for height. We then assessed associations of height and LHR with 15 major CMD. Both higher height and LHR are associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes(T2D), CAD, hypertension (HT), and myocardial infarction (MI). A low LHR (bottom 20%) was associated with a substantially higher risk of CAD than a medium (middle 60%) or high (top 20%) LHR, regardless of the height category. This pattern is even more pronounced for T2D, where tall individuals with low LHR exhibit higher risk (HR = 1.39 [1.29-1.49], P = 2.70×10<sup>-20</sup>) than individuals of short or medium height with higher LHR. Lipids (especially high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) primarily mediates the protective effect of LHR on CMD, whereas inflammatory markers (especially neutrophils) mainly mediate that of height. Mendelian randomization analyses using 674 SNPs support the protective effects of LHR on these four traits. Colocalization analyses revealed variants at LHR-associated loci that colocalize with CMD signals, such as a notable colocalization with T2D at the JAZF1 locus. 
In sum, our work suggests that LHR has independent and differential effects across 15 CMD traits. Lipids mainly mediate the protective association between LHR and CMD.
